Enhance the daily task management application with Persian calendar support

This commit introduces a robust Persian calendar integration, including conversion utilities and a `PersianDate` class. It also refactors the application structure with component-based JavaScript classes for Task Management, Review System, and Tab Management, along with styling updates using TailwindCSS and Persian typography. The `.replit` file is configured for running the application, and the `index.html` is updated with PWA meta tags and Persian font links.
